    <h3>1)what is node js? what is open source cross platform?</h3>
    <pre>
•	Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build and execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
•	It enables the execution of JavaScript on the server.
•	Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), real-time applications (such as chat applications or collaborative tools).
•	It made ability to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides, simplifying development and reducing the learning curve for web developers.
•	Node.js is an open source server environment
    </pre>
<h3>2)what is blocking vs non blocking?</h3>
    <pre>
In blocking I/O, when an I/O operation is requested, the application waits for the operation to complete before moving on to the next task. 
During this waiting period, the entire application is blocked, and it cannot execute other tasks or handle new requests until the I/O operation is finished.
In non-blocking I/O, when an I/O operation is requested, the application continues to execute other tasks or handle new requests without waiting for the I/O operation to complete.
    </pre>
<h3>3)what is NPM?</h3>
   <pre>
•	NPM stands for Node Package Manager, responsible for managing all the packages and modules for Node.js.
•	 It is the default package manager for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. 
•	NPM allows developers to discover, install, and manage various packages and modules written in JavaScript. 
•	These packages can contain reusable code, libraries, tools, and other assets that can be easily integrated into Node.js projects.
   </pre>
<h3>4)what are the modules in Node.js?</h3>
    <pre>
Modules are like JavaScript libraries that can be used in a Node.js application to include a set of functions. 
To include a module in a Node.js application, use the require() function with the parentheses containing the module's name.</pre>

<h3>5)What is Export,Import,Require Keyword?</h3>
    <pre>
In Node.js, the keywords "export," "import," and "require" are used to manage modules, which are reusable
blocks of code that can be imported and used in other parts of your application.

export:
The export keyword is used to expose functions, objects, or variables from a module so that they can be used in other parts of the application.
There are several ways to use export:
a) Named Exports
b)Default Exports
    </pre>

<h3>6)what is the purpose of module.exports?</h3>
    <pre>
When you create a local module in Node.js (a module that you define within your application), any variables, functions, 
or objects you declare within that module's file are by default private to that module. In other words, 
they are not accessible from other parts of your application unless you explicitly export them using module.exports.
    </pre>
<h3>7)Differnece between default export and named export?</h3>
    <pre>
The main difference between default export and named export lies in how you export and import modules in JavaScript.

Default Export:
1.With default export, you can only have one default export per module.
2.When you use the default export, you do not need to use curly braces {} while importing the module.
3.The default export is used when you want to export a single function, class, or object as the primary value of the module.
4.You can give any name to the default export when importing it, making it more flexible.

Named Export:
.With named export, you can export multiple functions, classes, or objects from a single module.
2.When using named export, you must use curly braces {} with the appropriate names while importing the module.
3.Named exports are used when you want to export multiple values from a module.
    </pre>
8)How do you import a file in Nodejs?
    <pre>
In Node.js, you can import a module using the require function for CommonJS modules or the import statement.
The method you use depends on the module system being used and the version of Node.js you are working with.
    </pre>

<h3>9)Difference between HTTP and HTTPS?</h3>
    <pre>
Security-Http is Not secure (plain text transmission)	whereas https Secure (data is encrypted during transmission)
URL-Http Scheme	Starts with "http://"	Whereas Https Starts with "https://"
Http Default Port	80	wheraes Https Default Port443
HTTP is not secure and transmits data in plain text, while HTTPS is secure and encrypts data during transmission. 
HTTPS requires an SSL/TLS certificate, and browsers display security indicators for HTTPS websites.
    </pre>

<h3>10)What is Express,how it helps to create a backend application,adavantages of using express?</h3>
    <pre>
express is a framework that adds more functionality than node to our app.we can use this framework in our app.it has functionalities like cors,cookieparser and much more.
advantages-routing,middleware.
    </pre>
<h3>11)What are different types of HTTP requests?</h3>
    <pre>
there are four types of HTTP requests 
1)GET-we can read the data 
2)POST-we can create the data 
3)PUT-we can update the data 
4)DELETE-we can delete the data.
